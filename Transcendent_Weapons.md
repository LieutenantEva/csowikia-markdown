## Trivia


* All of the weapons from this series are based off of fantasy creatures and professions.
* All weapon icons from this series used to have a unique solid background. The background was later removed due to the update of weapon grades, given a specific background color for easier recognition.
* This series is also known as the 'Buff Series' due to many of its members offering gameplay-enhancing buffs.
*  These weapons have hit-markers (except melee variants), which allow the users to know if they are hitting a target in any game mode. Note that the hit-markers are available in [Basic](<Basic>) mode for all weapons.
* This is the first series to bestow a number of buffs to the owner, and even the rest of the players within a room, albeit just a small share for the latter.
* The buff effects are not stacked if the player owns more than one primary weapon from this series.
* Players who possess the weapons and classes from this series will have an icon displayed next to their nicknames as well as the room name to notify the others with an exception to melee and secondary variants. 
* * Placing the mouse onto this icon will show their buffed weapon (Primary weapons only, with some weapons excluded) and classes in possession.
* During the first release, AK-47 Paladin and M4A1 Dark Knight were obtainable after collecting 888 [Transcendence Piece](<Transcendence_Piece>)s. (except Indonesia, which was released in [Transcendence Decoder](<Transcendence_Decoder>)).
* Almost half of the weapons from this series cannot undergo Premium [Weapon Enhancement](<Weapon_Enhancement>).
* Dual Sword Phantom Slayer and Dual Beretta Gunslinger are the first weapons in this series to have an applicable special paint, which also shares the same paint with [Magnum Launcher](<Magnum_Launcher>).
* So far, [M3 Black Dragon](<M3_Black_Dragon>) and [Thunder Ghost Walker](<Thunder_Ghost_Walker>) are the only elevated Transcendent weapons from another game entirely, being from *[Counter-Strike Online 2](<Counter-Strike_Online_2>)*.
* [Infinity Laser Fist](<Infinity_Laser_Fist>) is the first submachine gun under Transcendence Series.
* [Thunder Force](<Thunder_Force>) is the first weapon selled together with an Epic Weapon, [Divine Blaster](<Divine_Blaster>).
